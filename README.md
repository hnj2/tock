# Tock Embedded Operating System Development Fork

Congrats, you've stumbled over my humble contribution repository of
the [Tock embedded operating system](https://www.tockos.org/) written
in Rust.

For more information on Tock, please visit the
[website](https://www.tockos.org/) or the [main
repository](https://github.com/tock/tock).

I'm using this repository to push branches for PRs. If a branch
vanished here, it's either because it was merged upstream or you might
be able to find it [in the
archive](https://git.currently.online/leons/archive/tock/refs/?h=20210116/dev/64bit-alarm-driver).
